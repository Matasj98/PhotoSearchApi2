Hi. Welcome to my project - PhotoSearch.

It uses unsplash image retrieval API to show images by entered words.
It let's you save queries, which will not disapear after visiting again, 
because queries are saved in localStorage. 

Application shows first loading indicator when API data is retrieved, after that Application
displays loading indicators for each image before image is fully loaded.

Application is made using React.js, Redux - for state managment. I used React-hooks, because
I didn't need class additional functions, all lifecycle methods, functional components was enough
to achieve the result. Also performance is better using functional components.
I used redux-Thunk fom some actions/calculations/data retrieval in application.

The project is created from scratch, without using create-react-app.
